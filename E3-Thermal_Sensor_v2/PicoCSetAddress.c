// This PicoC program will attempt to change the I2C (SMBus) address of a 
// thermal sensor from ADR_START to ADR_END. You must set up these two
// defines (immediately below this comment) properly. The ADR_START value
// must be the sensor's current address, and the ADR_END is what the new
// address is that you want it to move to. If you don't know what
// address your sensor is currently at, you can use the PicoCAddressScanner.c
// program to find it.
// This code will check to make sure it finds a sensor at ADR_START, then
// it will change the address,
// For a standard RCMx1 based system, don't use addresses 0x1c, 0x28, 0x29 
// or 0x30, since those are already used by devices on the I2C bus.
// If any failures are found during the process, these will be printed out
// and the process stopped.
// NOTE: After you have run this program (with no errors) you must reboot
// the sensor for it to appear on the new address.
